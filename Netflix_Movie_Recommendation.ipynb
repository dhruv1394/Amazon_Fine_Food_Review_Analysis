    "Netflix is all about connecting people to the movies they love. To help customers find those movies, they developed  a world-class movie recommendation system: CinematchSM. Its job is to predict whether someone will enjoy a movie based on how much they liked or disliked other movies. Netflix uses those predictions to make personal movie recommendations based on each customers' unique tastes. And while <b>Cinematch</b> was doing pretty well, it can always be made better.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>Note that there are a lot of interesting alternative approaches to how Cinematch works that Netflix hasn’t tried. Some are described in the literature, some aren’t. Netflix was curious whether any of these recommendations could beat Cinematch by making better predictions, because if there is a much better approach to recommend movies it could make a big difference Netflix's overall business and customer satisfaction.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Netflix gave an overall time period of 5 Years ( from October 2, 2006 to October 2,2011) to figure out an approach that could beat Cinematch in terms of movie recommendations, with the winner getting a prize money of 1 Million USD.\n",
    "* Netflix is an online repository where people can watch Movies, TV Series, Documentaries etc, which recommends new videos based on the videos that we have seen in the past.\n",
    "* *Netflix would recommend Movies, TV Series or Documentaries that the viewer might be interested in.* The process to carry this out is like suppose there is a user Ui on Netflix that watches the Movie Mj and gives a corresponding rating Rij which is between 1 star and 5 stars.\n",
    "* Thus, using the rating information for thousands of users and tens of thousands of movies, if we can somehow predict the type of movies that this particular user might like in the future, it is very useful."

    "* From above plot we can conclude that it took us roughly 8.88 sec for computing the simlilar users for a single user. This means that computing the similarity values for a user Ui and all the other users (U1,U2,U3.....U405K) {this is basically the same as computing the dot product between Ui and all the other users}, and to obtain the top similar users for Ui, it takes about 8.88 seconds.\n",

    "\n",
    "* *Basically, it would take us 41 days to compute this for all of our users ie. to compute the Su.*\n",
    "*  Since there are 4 cores on any of our modern computers, we can parallelize this entire process such that we can compute for a single user parallely on one of our 4 cores : We can compute the similar users to U1 on Core 1, similar users to U2 on Core 2 and so on. *But the problem is that even if we parallelize this entire operation on 4 cores, it would still take us 10.5 days to obtain our Su.*\n",
    "\n",
    "===================================================================================================================\n",
    "\n",
    "* Since each of our users belongs to 17K Dimensions, one of the ideas that we can think about is to carry out Dimensionality Reduction to 500 or so dimensions. Eg : Ui~ with 500 Dimensions. Now we can compute Su on these Ui~ values. *This can be easily achieved by the use of SVD or any of our Dimensionality Reduction Techniques (PCA,TSNE etc).*\n",
    "* We carry out this entire analysis as shown below, but there is a flaw in this approach. The earlier approach after parallelization (4-Cores) resulted in Su computation in 10.5 days, whereas now this approach would take a longer time : 14 - 15 days."

The absolute values do not matter as much.*\n",

    "# 6. Conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "The Business Problem that we were trying to solve over here was to Recommend Movies to Users on Netflix. Netflix had its own CineMatch Movie Recommendation Algorithm which carries out its own Implementation. However, the important point is that there are many alternative approaches than the algorithmic approach that is followed by CineMatch, both present in literature as well as some innovations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Error Metric that Netflix was using was RMSE, which is the Evaluation Metric that we took into consideration, with the challenge being to improve CineMatch's RMSE Value by 10%. However, we also consider MAPE as another evaluation metric to understand the relative error differences. Along with this, we knew that our Models need to be somewhat interpretable so that the user knows why a particular Movie/TV Show is being recommended to him/her.\n",
    "\n",
    "We carried out Temporal Splitting of our Total Data into Train and Test Datasets, with the oldest 80% of our data being Training Data and the latest 20% being our Test Dataset, after which we carried out EDA on top of the Training Data. After this, we created Sparse Matrix from our Dataframe because we needed our Data to be present in a Matrix Format to work with, after which we computed the values of the Global Average of Ratings, the User Average as well as Movie Average.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Netflix is a Rapidly growing platform over the past few years and hence we will face challenges, such as where we do not know what to recommend to a user who has just joined Netflix : This Problem is called the Cold Start Problem. </b> We observed that this Cold Start Problem is severe in the Case of Users and is not very severe when it comes to Movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, we tried to compute the User-User as well as Movie-Movie Similarity Matrices, and we realise by running for a Sample of 100 users, that to run this entire code snippet for 405K users would take us > 41 days, which even after parallelization still takes approx. 10.5 days (using 4 Cores). To overcome this problem, we developed a hack such that we created a dictionary of dictionaries to store these values, and we compute the User-User Similarities as and when needed, at runtime : We do not compute the entire matrix to start with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we take a Sample of 10K Users and 1K movies out of our entire dataset which consisted of 405K users and 17K Movies. This sample size was considered only for faster execution of our code, even though we know that by increasing the number of users as well as movies, our Test RMSE Values will most likely decrease considerably. {In order to check the difference in the results, we run all of our Models with different featurizations once again, where we take a sample size of 25K Users and 3K Movies}. I would have definitely loved to increase this sample size, and maybe try and work on the entire dataset without Sampling, but working on this small sample dataset itself took me more than 3 days of System Runtime for Featurizing the Train Data, and another 8-9 hours to Featurize the Test Data, because of System constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "We apply multiple models on our samples : Models such as using 13 Handcrafted Features (5 Most Similar Users, 5 Most Similar Movies, User Avg, Movie Avg, Global Avg) etc., Surprise Baseline Model feature, KNNbaseline Surprise Model with both User-User and Movie-Movie computations, and the Matrix Factorization Techniques of SVD and SVD++. Summary of the Results that we obtained is as shown below using the 'PrettyTable' Library :"
